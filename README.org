3. (optional) elfeed-org - https://github.com/remyhonig/elfeed-org

** Sample configuration for 1 widget
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package dashboard
    :custom
    :config
    (use-package dashboard-elfeed
      :load-path "/path/to/emacs-dashboard-elfeed"

      :config
      (add-to-list 'dashboard-item-generators '(elfeed . dashboard-elfeed))
      (add-to-list 'dashboard-items '(elfeed) t))

    (setq dashboard-items '((recents  . 5)
                            (agenda . 5)
                            (elfeed . 1))))
#+end_src

** Sample configuration for 3 widgets
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package dashboard
    :custom
    :config
    (use-package dashboard-elfeed
      :load-path "/path/to/emacs-dashboard-elfeed"
      :custom
      (de/key "b")
      (de/dashboard-search-filter "+friends")
      (de/dashboard-search-filter-1 "+me")
      :config
      (add-to-list 'dashboard-item-generators '(elfeed . dashboard-elfeed))
      (add-to-list 'dashboard-items '(elfeed) t)
      (add-to-list 'dashboard-item-generators '(elfeed-1 . dashboard-elfeed-1))
      (add-to-list 'dashboard-items '(elfeed-1) t)
      (add-to-list 'dashboard-item-generators '(elfeed-2 . dashboard-elfeed-2))
      (add-to-list 'dashboard-items '(elfeed-2) t))

    (setq dashboard-items '((recents  . 5)
                            (agenda . 5)
                            (elfeed . 5)
                            (elfeed-1 . 1)
                            (elfeed-2 . 3))))
#+end_src

* Customization

** Variables
Variables the user can set:
- =(de/key "<key>")= -- sets the dashboard shortcut jump key for the widget
  - default value is =""=, effectively setting no key for the widget
  - Any conflicts with other shortcuts ([[https://github.com/emacs-dashboard/emacs-dashboard#shortcuts][some that dashboard uses]]) will mess up the dashboard
- =(de/dashboard-search-filter "<filter terms>")= -- set what the filter the widget should use
  - default value is ="@6-months-ago +unread"=
  - Look at [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed#filter-syntax][this]] for a better idea of filter terms

** Note about multiple
To add in another section, simply use the configuration for a singular and add =-[1, 2, 3, 4]= to the
 variable.

Eg:
- To add in a key for a second widget, do =(de/key-1 "c")=
- For a third widget, do =(de/key-1 "o")=

* Wish List
  1. [X] Ability for multiple widgets
  2. [ ] Have faces for color
  3. [ ] Prettify display
  4. [ ] Asynchronous updates
  5. [ ] Possibly cleaner code for duplicates

* Bugs
- Doesn't update for new feeds (requires user manually updating first)
- If a feed published 2 entries with the same title and attributes, it won't return them properly
  - This is unlikely to happen, but it may be worth looking into hashtables
  - Another possible solution (simpler/ foolproof) may be assigning an arbitrary key in display text
- When the user views the entry from dashboard, the entry is unmarked unread

* How you can contribute

Feel free to fork and make a pull request. I check github quite often, so I'll reply if I want any
clarification, and accept/ reject (rejections will receive a justified reason as to why they were
rejected). Looking for contributors and maintainers!
